🤖 ROBOTICS_PID_RL_SIMULATION

Today, we have autonomous robots and drones that can balance, track, and adapt — but the beauty lies in understanding how they learn and control themselves.

Instead of using ready-made control libraries, I decided to build my own intelligent controller — combining the precision of PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control with the adaptability of Reinforcement Learning (RL).

This project is a hands-on journey into how robots feel errors, learn corrections, and evolve toward optimal motion control. ⚙️

🧩 WHAT’S INSIDE THE CODE

📂 PID_Controller.py
Implementation of a classic PID loop to stabilize a robotic system (balance, speed, or angle).

📂 RL_Agent.py
A lightweight RL agent that learns to tune PID parameters dynamically for improved adaptability.

📂 Simulation_Environment.py
Simulated robotic environment (based on physics equations) where control and learning are tested.

📂 main.py
Brings everything together — initialize, run simulation, visualize graphs of control performance and learning reward.

⚙️ METHODOLOGY

Step 1: Initialize a robot simulation with error feedback.

Step 2: PID controller minimizes steady-state error.

Step 3: RL agent observes PID performance and adjusts parameters (Kp, Ki, Kd).

Step 4: Iterate until the system learns optimal control dynamics.

🎯 Goal: Achieve stable, smooth, and adaptive control using hybrid classical + AI methods.

📊 RESULTS

Stable trajectory convergence within a few training episodes.

Reduced overshoot and oscillations compared to static PID tuning.

Demonstrated adaptive response to environmental noise or parameter drift.

📈 The RL-tuned controller showed up to 35–40% improvement in error reduction vs fixed PID.
